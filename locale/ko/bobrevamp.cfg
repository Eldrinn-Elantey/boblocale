[mod-setting-description]
bobmods-revamp-nuclear=If enabled, this setting will change nuclear reactor 2 into a thorium reactor, and nuclear reactor 3 into a deuterium reactor, and restructure research accordingly.
bobmods-revamp-old-oil=If enabled, this setting will make changes to the oil processing production chain.\nIt also removes base game sulfur and sulfuric acid recipes and adds a means to get sulfur and sulfur dioxide if MCI is installed.
bobmods-revamp-oil=If enabled, this setting will make more realistic changes to the oil processing chain.\nIt replaces the petroleum gas output of oil processing with sour gas, which can be processed into petroleum gas.\nIt removes base game sulfur and sulfuric acid recipes and adds hydrogen sulfide to the sour gas processing recipe if MCI is installed.\nit will take priority over the older oil and sulfur overhaul.
